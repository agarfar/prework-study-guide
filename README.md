# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I designed this webpage to function as a Prework Study Guide; notes can be added to the body of the HTML page, and console commands can choose a random topic to study. I learned the basics of Github, HTML, CSS, and Javascript over the course of designing this webpage. 

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Usage

Each section contains prewritten notes about each topic. When opening the DevTools console, you can see JavaScript running. It will list the topics of the prework and choose one for the user to study.
